# Introducing Our Updated Web Development Services: Tailored Solutions for Every Business

After working with dozens of clients and listening to their feedback, I've restructured my service offerings to better align with what businesses actually need in 2025. The goal is simple: provide clear, transparent solutions that deliver real value without the confusion of complex pricing structures.

---

## Why I Restructured My Services

Many business owners come to me with a common frustration: they don't know what they need or how much it should cost. Web development pricing can be confusing, with some agencies charging $50,000 for a simple website while others offer the same for $500.

I've created a straightforward service menu that addresses specific business challenges at fair prices. Each service has a clear scope, transparent pricing, and defined deliverables.

## The Seven Services

### 1. Professional Landing Page Development — $800

**Perfect for:** Product launches, event promotion, lead generation campaigns

A landing page is a single-page website designed with one goal: convert visitors into leads or customers. If you're launching a new product, running a marketing campaign, or need a quick online presence, this is your solution.

**What's included:**
- Responsive design optimized for all devices
- SEO fundamentals (meta tags, structured data, fast loading)
- Contact form with email notifications
- 95+ Lighthouse performance score
- 1-2 week delivery

**Why it matters:** Studies show that businesses with dedicated landing pages convert 2-3x better than those sending traffic to generic homepages. A well-designed landing page pays for itself quickly.

---

### 2. Professional Business Website — $2,500

**Perfect for:** Established businesses, professional services, portfolios

This is the complete package for businesses that need a professional online presence. A 5-10 page website that showcases your services, builds credibility, and converts visitors into customers.

**What's included:**
- Custom design tailored to your brand
- 5-10 pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.)
- SEO optimization for local and organic search
- Google Analytics integration
- 30 days of post-launch support
- 3-4 week delivery

**Real example:** GSM AC and RC Beauty Salon are built using this approach. Both sites generate consistent leads and establish professional credibility for the businesses.

---

### 3. Custom Business Management Dashboard — $5,000

**Perfect for:** Service businesses, operations management, workflow automation

If you're spending hours on repetitive tasks—managing appointments, sending emails, tracking data—a custom dashboard can save you 15+ hours per week. This isn't a generic tool; it's built specifically for your business processes.

**What's included:**
- Custom forms and data entry workflows
- Data visualization and reporting
- User management with role-based access
- Email automation triggers
- Database integration
- 60 days of support
- 5-6 week delivery

**The ROI argument:** If you value your time at $50/hour and save 15 hours weekly, that's $750/week or $39,000/year. A $5,000 investment pays for itself in less than 7 weeks.

---

### 4. E-Commerce Website Development — $6,000

**Perfect for:** Retail businesses, online stores, product-based companies

Selling products online requires more than a pretty website. You need secure payment processing, inventory management, order tracking, and a seamless customer experience. This solution delivers all of that.

**What's included:**
- Complete online store setup
- Secure payment gateway integration (Stripe)
- Inventory management system
- Order processing and tracking
- Customer accounts and purchase history
- Admin dashboard for management
- 90 days of support
- 6-10 week delivery

**Important consideration:** E-commerce success depends on more than technology. I help you understand the full picture—including marketing, fulfillment, and customer service strategies.

### 5. Website Redesign and Modernization — $3,000

**Perfect for:** Businesses with outdated websites, legacy code, poor performance

Is your website slow, outdated, or embarrassing to share? A redesign transforms your online presence from a liability into an asset. We don't just apply a fresh coat of paint—we rebuild with modern technology.

**What's included:**
- Complete visual redesign
- Performance optimization (faster loading)
- Mobile-responsive upgrade
- Content migration from old site
- SEO enhancement and preservation
- Technology modernization (Next.js, React)
- 45 days of support
- 4-6 week delivery

**The hidden cost of bad websites:** Slow websites lose 7% of conversions for every second of delay. If your site takes 5 seconds to load instead of 2, you're losing roughly 21% of potential customers.

---

### 6. Custom Web Application Development — $8,000+

**Perfect for:** Startups, enterprise solutions, unique business requirements

When off-the-shelf software doesn't fit your needs, a custom web application solves the problem. Whether it's a booking system, member portal, SaaS product, or internal tool, we build it from scratch.

**What's included:**
- Custom functionality built to your specifications
- Database architecture design
- API development and integrations
- User authentication and security
- Third-party service integrations
- Comprehensive documentation
- 6 months of priority support
- 8-12+ week delivery

**Why custom beats generic:** Generic software forces you to adapt your business to the tool. Custom software adapts the tool to your business. The efficiency gains compound over time.

---

### 7. Monthly Website Maintenance and Support — $200/month

**Perfect for:** Any business that wants peace of mind

Websites aren't "set it and forget it." Security vulnerabilities emerge, software needs updates, content becomes outdated, and performance degrades. Monthly maintenance prevents small issues from becoming expensive emergencies.

**What's included:**
- Security patches and updates
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Content updates (text, images, minor changes)
- Backup management
- Uptime monitoring
- Same-day response for urgent issues
- Technical support via email/chat

**The math:** One security breach can cost thousands in recovery, lost business, and reputation damage. $200/month is insurance against disaster while keeping your site at peak performance.

## My Technology Stack

Every project is built with modern, proven technologies:

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| UI Library | React 19 |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| ORM | Prisma |
| Authentication | NextAuth.js |
| Payments | Stripe |
| Emails | Resend |
| Hosting | Vercel |

**Why this stack?** These technologies are used by companies like Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb. You get enterprise-grade technology at small business prices.

---

## Transparent Pricing Philosophy

I believe in clear, upfront pricing for several reasons:

1. **Respect for your time** — You shouldn't need multiple calls to learn what something costs
2. **Budget planning** — You can evaluate options before reaching out
3. **Trust building** — Hidden costs erode trust; transparency builds it
4. **Fair value** — My prices reflect the actual work involved, not what I think you can afford

### Payment Structure

For project-based work (everything except maintenance):
- **50% deposit** to begin work
- **50% final payment** upon completion

For maintenance:
- **Monthly subscription** billed automatically
