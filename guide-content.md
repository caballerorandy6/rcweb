- Thumb-friendly navigation essential
- Patience is lower (speed matters more)

**Google's Mobile-First Indexing**

- Not mobile-friendly = penalty in search results

### Mobile Design Best Practices

**1. Responsive Design**

- Fluid grids and flexible images
- CSS media queries for different breakpoints
- Test on real devices, not just browser tools

**2. Touch-Friendly Interface**

- Adequate spacing between clickable elements
- Avoid hover-dependent interactions
- Large, easy-to-tap CTAs

**3. Simplified Navigation**
- Hamburger menu for mobile
- Maximum 5 main menu items
- Search functionality prominent
- Breadcrumbs for deep navigation

**4. Optimized Content**
- Shorter paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Larger font sizes (16px minimum)
- Bullet points and scannable content
- Images that scale properly

**5. Fast Loading**

- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)
- Desktop (various resolutions)

### Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Modern approach combining web and app features:

**Benefits:**
